## Dataset: Kaggle FlameVison
It's an opensource dataset, we can download it from easily from this website: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/anamibnjafar0/flamevision

## How to build the LAFNET on ultralytics yolov5 environment
### The model is base on ultralytics yolov5 framework of version 7.0 
https://github.com/ultralytics/yolov5

Ongoing efforts to build the repo ...

## How to deploy LAFNET on Nvidia edge computing device.

LAFNET can be deployed by tensorRT_Pro-YOLOv8 framework https://github.com/Melody-Zhou/tensorRT_Pro-YOLOv8
or its base repo https://github.com/shouxieai/tensorRT_Pro

1. Install environmental dependency tensorRT_Pro.
2. Convert the pytorch pt model to onnx model.
